Ecommerce website - bookstore.
Ecommerce has two types of users: admin and regular user.
There are sign up and sign in functionality that are done with use of Passport library on back-end and Formik on front-end.
Administrator has his own dashboard where he can create/update/remove products, create categories, change status of orders and view them.
Administrator and regular users have the possibility to change their user details (name and email).
Users can add products to the cart and purchase them using credit cards.
Also users can see their purchase history in their personal dashboard.
Users have the possibility of sorting the products based on categories and price.

Tech-stack:

  Back-end:
    Node Js,
    Express,
    JWT,
    Passport,
    Mongoose,
    MongoDB,
    
  Front-end:
  
    React Js,
    Bootstrap,
    Braintree for payments,
    Formik,
    
Project styles are simple, because for me the real goal of this application was to practice constructing full-stack application logic - wiring front-end and back-end, practicing on doing CRUD. So styles are really just to add some a bit nicer look, but no more than that :)

To start up the project, simply run "yarn install" in server and client directories and then run "yarn start" in those directories. Also start your mongoDB server.

Thank you for being interested in this :)
